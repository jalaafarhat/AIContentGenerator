This project is an AI-powered content generation website with user authentication and subscription plans. The website enables users to register, log in, and utilize AI tools for creating custom content tailored to their needs. The project is a practical implementation from an Udemy course I followed, designed to build real-world applications using modern web development techniques.

Note: The project is currently unfinished and is a work in progress.
